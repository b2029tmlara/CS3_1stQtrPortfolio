#  List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences. 
1. **Common Conditional Statements**: Having learned some basic programming in python prior to transferring to Pisay, these were certainly not that far from my understanding. I was able to effectively or at least decently practice them for all if not many of my Q1 CS3 exercises, graded or non-graded.
2. **Variable Declaration**: This for me was the easiest topic, as all I had to do was create a variable name in camelCase format, and use an assignment operator "=" in order to give it its value. All of my code or programs have this simple yet essential topic observed in them.
3. **Ternary Operators**: Aside from the common conditional statements, a lesser-known type  are ternary operators used only for very small-scale conditions. As soon as I was taught these, I was able to practice them when coding simple tasks. 
4. **JS Overview**: I learned about how JavaScript is a dynamically or loosely typed language with easier syntax and control over a handful of languages. Moreober, I learned about its integral part in the creation of websites
5. **JS Syntax**: Having finished Q1 in CS3, I learned the basic syntax for JavaScript. This topic is applicable to all aspects of CS3 such as coding exercises, hence my mastery in it.
   
#  List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed. 
1. **Function Declaration**:
2. **For Loops**: I need more discussion on the application of for loops as this was my first time encountering it, and while I did the practice exercises and aced them, it is different from actual LT conditions wherein I have to code such structures under time pressure. 
3. **While Loops**: I need more discussion on while loops as sometimes they typically involve loops inside them also, which also proved confusing to me, being a first-timer in taking up a full computer science class as a transferee. 
4. **Do...While Loops**:I need further discussion on do...while loops as these were not fully discussed for me and lacked some examples as I am admittedly a student who needs a considerable amount of them in order to fully grasp a concept, esppecially for independent application. 
5. **How to Do Well in a VPL Exam**: Having taken my first few sets of VPL exams, I need assistance on how I can actually use the features of the VPL in order to adjust my code for a better automatic grade
   
#  Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why? */
## Effective for Me:
1. **Graded Exercises**: These allow me to fully practice the concepts discussed in class, and to find out any gaps in knowledge I may have prior to pivotaal assessments in the quarter.
2. **Interactive Discussions**: Interactive discussions with the teacher on OneCompiler on VSCode and running code live allows me to fully immerse myself in the process and explore a variety of coding approaches under the guidance of my CS3 teacher. 
## Not Effective for Me: 
1. **Speed Tests**: Speed tests without supervision are quite challenging for me and often take up most time, and consultation is limited.
2. **Few Examples**: Providing only a few examples for certain concepts has caused some gaps in my knowledge, and subsequently misconceptions about certain situations or ways in coding a given task/
